							<h1>Aaron Feng</h1>
							<p class="major">
								<p>I'm currently a graduate student studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of 
									Michigan Ann Arbor. Growing up, I witnessed the development and technical breakthroughs of reusable 
									rockets, private spaceflight, robotic interplanetary exploration, sustainable 
									transportation, and more. This led me to develop a strong passion for engineering, a desire to push the 
									boundaries of what is possible, and to create a lasting impact on society. 
								</p>
								<p>Throughout my extensive work experiences in the aerospace
									and automotive industries, I have gained skills and perspectives in many aspects of engineering, 
									including design, analysis/simulation, software, and 
									manufacturing. This portfolio details those, as well as some of the other projects that I've worked on.

						<p> I evaluated heat management with composite materials and potential range improvements for EDV and R1S.
							I also automated a StarCCM+ simulation workflow, reducing the number of steps by 66%. 
							Furthermore, I developed long term insulation pack by optimizing insulation location and R-value,
							and determined evaporator cooling power required for varying ambient conditions, for human comfort/safety in EDV cargo compartment.
							I quantified benefits of different EDV roof colors, conducted material stack configuration, fan characterization testing.

						<p> I streamlined the Model Y fascia assembly line and reduced cycle time using process flow layouts and time studies.
							I also designed and assembled quality inspection light filters, and a 2QPC buffer storage method to accommodate urgent process needs.
							I established standard work procedures for fascia assembly process, trained operators, and supported production teams. 
							Finally, I presented and coordinated a major design change review for the assembly line, reducing finished goods transfer time by 70%.

						<p> I conducted Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA) on headlamps and taillamps. 
							I also employed CAD to model products, improved structural stiffness of proposed products. 
							I designed, assembled, and validated a green filter headlamp prototype which was adopted by GM as a benchmark/proof of concept,

						<h2>Electrospray Space Microthruster</h2>
						<p>
							I worked with a team to design and analyze a thruster for ME553 (Microelectromechanical Systems).
							Electrospray microthruster technology shows potential for applications
							such as small satellite missions due to low mass, compact size, adaptability, modularity, and precise propulsive forces. 
							Literature reviews were conducted to incorporates nanoscale emitters 
							that can achieve higher thrust densities and exploit geometric trends. 
							A microthruster was then proposed / designed to meet mass, thrust, specific impulse, and input voltage specifications for a lunar cubesat.

							<h2>Robot Machine Player</h2>
							<p>A remote-controlled robot that was designed and manufactured to compete and win the ME250 (Design & Manufacturing I) competition. 
								Key objectives included the ability to traverse rough terrain/inclines, 
								hold open a door, collecting cubes from the other robots, picking cubes up, 
								and transporting cubes. Constraints included dimensions, cost, and number of motors used. 
								Extensive waterjetting, laser cutting, mill/lathe was used for aluminum and 
								acrylic stock, in addition to 3D printing for rapid iteration.
								Mechanisms used included rollers, a double gearbox, and conveyor belt.

							<h2>Mechatronics Linkage</h2>
							<p> A four-bar linkage that was designed and manufactured to compete and win the ME350 (Design & Manufacturing II) competition. 
								The objective was to rotate a flashlight to target various photosensors indicated by raised flags
								located throughout a playing field. Using proximity sensors, the system detected 
								the state of the flags, and used a controller and PID control to move the light beam to the necessary 
								location and orientation. The team designed and simulated a lightweight system that was rigid, 
								minimized rotational inertia and traversal time, had a relatively low transmission angle deviation, 
								and was consistent / simple to setup. Calibration was performed using a limit switch and by accounting for hysteresis.

								using high aspect ratio wings and a blended body. Controlled using 2 channels (elevons). 
								Camera is removable and mounted below the fuselage for good field of view. 
								Potential future work could involve autonomous/preplanned flights. 
								Like most engineering projects, it's heavily delayed - manufacturing is still in progress.

							<p> Smart, low cost faucet attachment that uses a flow meter to measure the water flow rate and volume through a faucet.
								An Arduino in a 3D printed case calculates the total water usage through a flow meter, and sends the data through Bluetooth 
								to a user-friendly Android app. The objective was to reduce water consumption through improved 
								monitoring and awareness (ironically, a lot of water was used in order to validate the prototype).
