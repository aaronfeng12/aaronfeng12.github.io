					<h1>Aaron Feng</h1>
					<p class="major">
						<p>I am currently a graduate student studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of 
							Michigan Ann Arbor. Growing up, I witnessed the development and technical breakthroughs of reusable 
							rockets, private spaceflight, robotic interplanetary exploration, sustainable 
							transportation, and more. This led me to develop a strong passion for engineering, a desire to push the 
							boundaries of what is possible, and to create a lasting impact on society. 
						</p>
						<p>Throughout my extensive work experiences in the aerospace
							and automotive industries, I have gained skills and perspectives in many aspects of engineering, 
							including design, simulation/analysis, software, and 
							manufacturing. This portfolio details those, as well as some of the other projects that I have worked on.

						<h2>Relativity Space / Thermal Engineering Intern</h2>
						<p>
							Long Beach, CA (May 2023 - Aug 2023, May 2024 - July 2024)
						</p>
						<p> Further solidifying my previous experience in simulation/analysis, here
							I developed an internal convection tool and GUI that allowed for various input parameters and geometries,
							implemented a simulation post processing tool for obtaining the heat flow between subgroups, and evaluated
							the transient buildup of frost on the exterior of the launch vehicle. 
							I also created and analyzed thermal models of the Terran R throttle valve actuator, electrical cables, 
							and thermal protection system.

							Ann Arbor, MI (Jan 2024 - May 2024)

							Primarily, I taught and guided students to run/troubleshoot vibration, vapor compression cycle, 
							aluminum tensile/fracture, DC motor, and wind tunnel equipment/experiments. 
							In addition, I held office hours, answered technical questions, and graded
							students' lab reports.

						<h2>Rivian / Aerothermal Systems Engineering Intern</h2>
						<p>
							Irvine, CA (May 2022 - Aug 2022)
						</p>
						<p> I evaluated heat management with composite materials and the associated potential range improvements for EDV and R1S.
							In addition, I automated a StarCCM+ simulation workflow, reducing the number of steps by 66%. 
							Furthermore, I developed a long term insulation pack for human comfort by optimizing insulation location, geometry, material, and thickness; 
							this solution was used in 15,000 vehicles. It took into
							account various factors, including forced convection from external airflow, the varying solar heat load thoroughout the day, and the cargo door. 
							I also determined evaporator cooling power required for varying ambient conditions, for human comfort/safety in EDV cargo compartment.
							Finally, I quantified the benefits of different EDV roof colors, and conducted material stack configuration and fan characterization testing. 
							This was a great experience in approaching and reducing complex problems comprehensively, in order to fully understand and explore the entire design
							space when searching for a solution.

						<h2>Tesla / Manufacturing Engineering Intern</h2>
						<p>
							Austin, TX (Jan 2022 - May 2022)
						</p>
						<p> I streamlined the Model Y fascia assembly line and reduced the cycle time using process flow layouts and time studies.
							I also designed and assembled quality inspection light fixtures, as well as a 2QPC buffer storage method to accommodate urgent process needs.
							I established standard work procedures for the front and rear fascia assembly process, trained operators, and supported production teams. 
							Finally, I presented and coordinated a major design change review for the assembly line, reducing finished goods transfer time by 70%.
							I learned a lot about managing and balancing the diverse goals and requirements of multiple stakeholders.

						<h2>H.A. Automotive Systems / Design Engineering Intern</h2>
						<p>
							Troy, MI (June 2021 - Jan 2022)
						</p>
						<p> I conducted Design Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (DFMEA) on headlamps and taillamps. 
							I also employed CAD to model products, as well as improve the structural stiffness of proposed products. 
							In particular, I designed, assembled, and validated a green filter headlamp prototype which was adopted by GM as a benchmark/proof of concept, 
							resulting in $100,000 additional market value revenue. Highlights included designing an entirely new heat sink for this application, as well as 
							conducting optical/colorimetry testing. Overall, I learned how to own a product from start to end of 
							the engineering process.

						<h2>UAV</h2>
						<p> A 3D printed drone for aerial photography, designed for stability, long endurance, and heavy modular payloads. 
							My electric ducted fan powered design features a 48 in. wingspan, high aspect ratio wings, and is controlled using 2 elevons. 
							Camera is removable and mounted below the fuselage for good field of view. 
							Potential future work could involve autonomous/preplanned flights.

						<h2>Electrospray Microthruster</h2>
						<p>
							A thruster that was designed and analyzed for ME553 (Microelectromechanical Systems).
							Electrospray microthruster technology shows potential for applications
							such as small satellite missions due to low mass, compact size, adaptability, modularity, and precise propulsive forces. 
							Literature reviews were conducted to incorporate nanoscale emitters 
							that can achieve higher thrust densities and exploit geometric trends. 
							A microthruster was proposed/sized to meet mass, thrust, specific impulse, and input voltage specifications for a lunar cubesat.

						<h2>Mechatronics Linkage</h2>
						<p> A four-bar linkage that was designed and manufactured to compete and win the ME350 (Design & Manufacturing II) competition. 
							The objective was to rotate a flashlight to target various photosensors indicated by raised flags
							located throughout a playing field. Using proximity sensors, the system detected 
							the state of the flags, and used a controller and PID control to move the light beam to the necessary 
							location and orientation. The team designed and simulated a lightweight system that was rigid, consistent/simple to setup, 
							minimized rotational inertia and traversal time, and had a relatively low transmission angle deviation. 
							Calibration was performed using a limit switch and accounted for hysteresis.

							Key objectives included the ability to traverse rough terrain/inclines, 
							hold open a door, collect cubes from the other robots, pick cubes up, 
							and transport cubes. Constraints included dimensions, cost, and number of motors used. 
							Extensive waterjetting, laser cutting, and mill/lathe was used, in addition to 3D printing for rapid iteration.
							Mechanisms used included rollers and a conveyor belt.

						<h2>Smart Sink</h2>
						<p> Smart, low cost faucet attachment that measures the water rate and volume through a faucet.
							An Arduino in a 3D printed case calculates the total water usage through a flow meter, and sends the data through Bluetooth

							monitoring and awareness (ironically, a lot of water was used in order to validate the prototype).
